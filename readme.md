This is a starbucks webscraper code, it will dynamically extract information of each drink from the starbucks website

it will look at website and then open each link for each drink and pull the information from all drinks with all of their sizes

for example: caramel machiatto comes in 3 sizes, each size has different portion (pump amounts etc..)
